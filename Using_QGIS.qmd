## Downlodading QGIS

We'll be working with the latest version of QGIS: v 3.28.3 which you can download [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

* Set QGIS up **before** attending the workshop if you'd like to follow along.

## 1 Setting up a Project

### Downloading the Data

Click <a href="/Data/Workshop_Data.zip" download="">here</a> to download the data for the workshop.  Extract the data to your project folder.

* **Tip**:  I like to start every project in a "clean directory".
    * Create a folder called "GIS_Workshop" in your working directory.  This can be any directory, just make sure you remember where it is!  In this example, I'm working in C:\temp
    * Create another folder within that called "Data" - this can be where you save all the data for a project

* You can then extract the .zip file you downloaded to "GIS_Workshop\Data\"

### Opening QGIS

You can then open QGIS, which will create an new "untitled" project.  Click Project>Save in the top left, and save the project in "base" of your new project directory.

* Don't save in the data folder.  You want your project file to be in the first thing you see when you open a your project.

## 2 Adding Data

You should be able to find your project folder in the directory browser.

* Expand the **Data** folder so you can see the contents.

### Importing a .shp file

Try clicking on BC_subDivs_2022.shp and dragging it to your layers tab.

* If you get an error message, take note of what it says, but ignore it for now.

It is **very** important to check what coordinate system your data layers are in when import a new layer.

* This is the first thing you should do each time you import a layer.

### Importing a .csv file

The point data (police involved deaths) is stored in a different format.  To import it, you must go to **Layers>Add Layer>Add Delimited Text Layer**.  If you try to drag it onto the map the same way you did with the .shp file, it won't show anything.

* **csv**: comma separated value format is a tabular data format with values separated by commas.  This isn't a spatial data format, *though it can contain spatial data*.  We just need to go through some extra steps to make it work.
    * This file has numerous columns, including point locations (Lat/Long)
    * We need to specify the coordinates (x,y data) and coordinate system (WGS 1984) when importing our data
* If you did the import correctly, the new layer should appear overtop the old, even though the are in different coordinate systems.
    * This is know as "project on the fly"

## 3. Reprojecting a layer

The PID layer is showing point locations that are recorded in Latitude and Longitude using the WGS 1984 coordinate system.  This is different than the BC Albers Equal Area projection we are using for the census data layer (BC_subDivs_2022).  Its best practice to ensure **all** data layers are **always** in the **same** projection before doing anything else.

* Processes may still run when the layers have different coordinate systems, but the results will be less accurate and the processing will take longer because the software will have to reproject layers on the fly.
    * It is easier to just reproject the data **once**.
* Search the **Processing Toolbox** for the **Reproject** function
    * Reprojecting will create a new layer in the desired coordinate system.
    * Make sure to reproject the **PID_Locations** layer
    * Make sure to put it in the **BC Albers** projection
* You can then remove the old PID_locations layer as we don't need it anymore

4. Intersect points with sub divisions

    * We want to count number of incidents per subdivision

5. Calculate rate of police involved deaths

    * Divide total deaths per subdivision by total population per subdivision

6. Map the deaths per subdivision
