## Downlodading QGIS

We'll be working with the latest version of QGIS: v 3.28.3 which you can download [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

* Set QGIS up **before** attending the workshop if you'd like to follow along.

## Setting up a Project

### Downloading the Data

Click <a href="/Data/Workshop_Data.zip" download="">here</a> to download the data for the workshop.  Extract the data to your project folder.

* **Tip**:  I like to start every project in a "clean directory".
    * Create a folder called "GIS_Workshop" in your working directory.  This can be any directory, just make sure you remember where it is!  In this example, I'm working in C:\temp
    * Create another folder within that called "Data" - this can be where you save all the data for a project

* You can then extract the .zip file you downloaded to "GIS_Workshop\Data\"

### Opening QGIS

You can then open QGIS, which will create an new "untitled" project.  Click Project>Save in the top left, and save the project in "base" of your new project directory.

* Don't save in the data folder.  You want your project file to be in the first thing you see when you open a your project.

## Adding Data

You should be able to find your project folder in the directory browser.

* Expand the **Data** folder so you can see the contents.

Try clicking on BC_subDivs_2022.shp and dragging it to your layers tab.

* If you get an error message, take note of what it says, but ignore it for now.

It is **very** important to check what coordinate system your data layers are in when import a new layer.

* This is the first thing you should do each time you import a layer.

3. Import points from CSV and project to BC Albers

    * Data is in Lat/Long WGS 1984

4. Intersect points with sub divisions

    * We want to count number of incidents per subdivision

5. Calculate rate of police involved deaths

    * Divide total deaths per subdivision by total population per subdivision

6. Map the deaths per subdivision
