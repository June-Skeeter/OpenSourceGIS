## What is GIS?

The **GI** stands for **Geographic Information**.  The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**.  You will often see them used interchangeably because they are closely related.  Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*.

## What is GIScience?

The science and study of geospatial information: 

* GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  
* It is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping 
    * It is inherently multidisciplinary and draws on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.

## What is a GISystem?

Any system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.

* Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  
* Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  
    * Ranging from the mobile applications to cloud computing systems that can process terabytes of planetary scale data.

## What can be done with GIS?

GIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: 

* Epidemiology/Public Health
* Planning (Urban, Hazards)
* Conservation & Resource Management
* Economics
* Climate Science
* Ecology/Biology
* Social Justice

# Accessing GISystems


## Proprietary GIS Software 

GIS is rooted in the capitalist enterprise.  Consequently many of the initial developments in GIS were by for profit companies.  

* [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) is a leading producer of GIS software.  They make ArcGIS Pro, one of the most widely used GIS applications.  
* **Proprietary** software requires users to purchase a license.  
    * Proprietary licenses are often expensive.  
    * They are a barrier to access for many uses.

## Open Source GIS Software

Open source software has proliferated in recent years.  The the internet has connected like-minded developers and allowed for collaboration across the globe.

* **Open Source** software is published under an open copyright license making it free to access.
    * Includes programming languages such as Python, R, Java applications such as QGIS and InkScape.
    * Open source software is more accessible because its free to download and use!

# Programmatic Approaches

## GIS & Coding

There are a number of free programming languages that can be used to do GIS, each having their own advantages.  Three commonly used languages include:

* Python: Great general purpose programming language that is easy to read/write with with numerous GIS packages.
* Javascript: The go to language for web-based maps and applications.
* R: A statistical programming language widely used in the sciences.
